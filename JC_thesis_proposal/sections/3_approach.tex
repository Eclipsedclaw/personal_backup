\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

This thesis follows two main approaches. First, I will show the simulation studies and software development to help GAPS and GRAMS on both the scientific and operational sides, see section \ref{subsec: Science Simulation Work and Software}. Second, on-site hardware development for both the GAPS and GRAMS experiments will be presented, illustrating how experimental techniques can be used to achieve the desired scientific results predicted by simulations, see section \ref{subsec: Hardware Development}.
