abstract = {{This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (ℓ ≳ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ∗ = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10-2, Ωbh2 = 0.02205 ± 0.00028, Ωch2 = 0.1199 ± 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 ± 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68\% errors on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter ΛCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002< 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 ± 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter ΛCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 ≲ ℓ ≲ 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an “anomaly” in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.}},

The stellar and gaseous discs provide virtually equal contributions to the galaxy gravitational potential at large galactocentric radii, but no obvious correlation is found between the radial distribution of dark matter and the distribution of stars or gas. Results of the best fit to the mass distribution in M33 picture a dark halo which controls the gravitational potential from 3 kpc outward, with a matter density which decreases radially as R−1.3. The density profile is consistent with the theoretical predictions for structure formation in hierarchical clustering cold dark matter (CDM) models, and favours lower mass concentrations than those expected in the standard cosmogony.}},

title = {Prospects of detecting dark matter through cosmic-ray antihelium with the antiproton constraints},
journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {Cosmic-ray (CR) antihelium is  an important observable for dark matter (DM) indirect searches  due to  extremely low secondary backgrounds towards low energies. In a given DM model, the predicted  CR antihelium flux is expected to be strongly  correlated  with that of CR antiprotons.  In this work, we use the AMS-02 p̄/p data to constrain the DM annihilation cross section, and the ALICE data on the 3H̄ē and T̄ productions   to determine the  parameters in the coalescence model  for anti-nucleus formation. The hadronic cross sections are estimated using Monte-Carlo event generators including EPOS-LHC and DPMJET. Based on these constraints, we make predictions for the maximal antihelium flux for typical  DM annihilation final states, and perform a detailed analysis on  the uncertainties due to  the DM density profiles and CR propagation models. We find that the  results are  highly insensitive to both of them, but still significantly depend on the  hadronization models in event generators. The prospects of detecting antihelium for the AMS-02 experiment is discussed. We show that with very optimistic assumptions, CR 3H̄ē is within the reach  of the AMS-02 experiment. The 3H̄ē events which can be detected by AMS-02  are likely to have kinetic energy  T ≳ 30 GeV, which is consistent with the preliminary AMS-02 search results. The events which can be observed by AMS-02 are likely to arise dominantly from secondary backgrounds rather than DM interactions.}

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {Antideuteron and antihelium nuclei have been proposed as promising detection   channels for dark matter because of the low astrophysical backgrounds   expected. To estimate both potential exotic contributions and their   backgrounds, one usually employs the coalescence model in momentum   space. Here we use instead a newly developed coalescence model based on   the Wigner function representations of the produced nuclei states. This   approach includes both the process-dependent size of the formation region of   antinuclei, and the momentum correlations of coalescing antinucleons in a   semi-classical picture. The model contains a single universal parameter   σ that we tune to experimental data on antideuteron production in   electron-positron, proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions. The obtained   value σ≃ 1 fm agrees well with its physical interpretation   as the size of the formation region of antinuclei in collisions of   point-like particles. This model allows us therefore to calculate in a   consistent frame-work the antideuteron and antihelium fluxes both from   secondary production and from dark matter annihilations. We find that the   antihelium-3 flux falls short by more than an order of magnitude   of the detection sensitivity of the AMS-02 experiment, assuming standard   cosmic ray propagation parameters, while the antideuteron flux can be   comparable to the sensitivities of the AMS-02 and GAPS experiments.}

abstract = {The General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS) is a novel approach for the indirect dark matter search that exploits cosmic antideuterons. GAPS utilizes a distinctive detection method using atomic X-rays and charged particles from the exotic atom as well as the timing, stopping range and dE/dX energy deposit of the incoming particle, which provides excellent antideuteron identification. In anticipation of a future balloon experiment, an accelerator test was conducted in 2004 and 2005 at KEK, Japan, in order to prove the concept and to precisely measure the X-ray yields of antiprotonic exotic atoms formed with different target materials [1]. The X-ray yields of the exotic atoms with Al and S targets were obtained as ∼ 75%, which are higher than were previously assumed in [2]. A simple, but comprehensive cascade model has been developed not only to evaluate the measurement results but also to predict the X-ray yields of the exotic atoms formed with any materials in the GAPS instrument. The cascade model is extendable to any kind of exotic atom (any negatively charged cascading particles with any target materials), and it was compared and validated with other experimental data and cascade models for muonic and antiprotonic exotic atoms. The X-ray yields of the antideuteronic exotic atoms are predicted with a simple cascade model and the sensitivity for the GAPS antideuteron search was estimated for the proposed long duration balloon program [3], which suggests that GAPS has a strong potential to detect antideuterons as a dark matter signature. A GAPS prototype flight (pGAPS) was launched successfully from the JAXA/ISAS balloon facility in Hokkaido, Japan in summer 2012 [4], [5] and a proposed GAPS science flight is to fly from Antarctica in the austral summer of 2017–2018.}

The other type has the proposed circular ring configuration with a much larger radius of 1289 mm. Both types have the same pipe length so that the circular OHP can be considered an “unfolded” layout of the serpentine OHP. The circular OHP has alternating heated and cooled sections at locations corresponding to the sections of the serpentine model. Each type has ten sets of these sections with check valves; the OHPs were oriented horizontally. The working fluid was HFC-134a. Both types of samples functioned normally, and their thermal resistances were almost identical. Each OHP showed traveling pressure waves during operation, which indicated a phase difference at each measuring point. The experiment showed that OHPs, with check valves and alternating heated and cooled sections, can transfer heat without the need for a serpentine configuration and that heat transfer routing can be designed more adaptably.}

This analysis demonstrates the GAPS sensitivity to cosmic-ray antiprotons using a full instrument simulation and event reconstruction, and including solar and atmospheric effects.}
