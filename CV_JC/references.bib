abstract = {The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) is an upcoming balloon mission to measure low-energy cosmic-ray antinuclei during at least three ∼35-day Antarctic flights. With its large geometric acceptance and novel exotic atom-based particle identification, GAPS will detect ∼500 cosmic antiprotons per flight and produce a precision cosmic antiproton spectrum in the kinetic energy range of ∼ 0.07−0.21 GeV/n at the top of the atmosphere. With these high statistics extending to lower energies than any previous experiment, and with complementary sources of experimental uncertainty compared to traditional magnetic spectrometers, the GAPS antiproton measurement will be sensitive to dark matter, primordial black holes, and cosmic ray propagation. The antiproton measurement will also validate the GAPS antinucleus identification technique for the antideuteron and antihelium rare-event searches. This analysis demonstrates the GAPS sensitivity to cosmic-ray antiprotons using a full instrument simulation and event reconstruction, and including solar and atmospheric effects.}

abstract = {Aimed at progress in mega-electron volt (MeV) gamma-ray astronomy, which has not yet been well-explored, Compton telescope missions with a variety of detector concepts have been proposed so far. One of the key techniques for these future missions is an event reconstruction algorithm that is able to determine the scattering orders of multiple Compton scattering events and to identify events in which gamma rays escape from the detectors before they deposit all of their energies. We revisit previous event reconstruction methods and propose a modified algorithm based on a probabilistic method. First, we present a general formalism of the probabilistic model of Compton scattering describing physical interactions inside the detector and measurement processes. Then, we also introduce several approximations in the calculation of the probability functions for efficient computation. For validation, the developed algorithm has been applied to simulation data of a Compton telescope using a liquid argon time projection chamber, which is a new type of Compton telescope proposed for the GRAMS project. We have confirmed that it works successfully for up to 8-hit events, including correction of incoming gamma-ray energies for escape events. The proposed algorithm can be used for next-generation MeV gamma-ray missions featured by large-volume detectors, e.g., GRAMS.}
